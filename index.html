        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi class, my name is Johny. I was always a creative kid and loved computers, but because of life events, I had to go down a more financial path. However, thanks to my loving partner I am able to try a more creative route for myself, so I decided to go back to school part time. Including my web development certification, I am also trying to get my degree in graphic design. My goal with this and my other classes is to soak in as much information as possible and see what my own abilities have to offer. Also to meet people and grow my network with like-minded passionate people.</p>
