        <h2>- Cerritos College information -</h2>
        <p>The college was founded in 1955. It was named after <b>Rancho Los Cerritos</b>, a local ranch in the 19th century. In turn the college was part of the inspiration for the renaming of the neighboring city of Dairy Valley to Cerritos. The district covers Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Downey, Norwalk, La Mirada, and Hawaiian Gardens.</p>
        <p>Originally, classrooms were rented in the now defunct <b>Excelsior High School</b> in September 1956. On July 24, 1957, the Cerritos Junior College District won the case against Dairy Valley (now Cerritos) to use the undeveloped land as an educational site. In September 1959, the college moved from Excelsior High School to the current site.</p>
